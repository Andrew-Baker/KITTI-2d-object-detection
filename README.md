# KITTI 2D Object Detection

## Abstract
Recent advances in deep learning based object detection techniques have revolutionized their use-cases in many fields. However, most deep learning based methods for computer vision tasks rely heavily on large amounts of high quality labelled training data.

Annotating such data is laborious and time-consuming, thus making it cost-prohibitive for tasks for which the labels are particularly difficult to acquire such as instance segmentation or depth estimation.

Synthetic data is an attractive alternative because data annotation is essentially free. The immediate problem with such synthetic data is the requirement of carefully designing simulation environments or using real environments as a starting point. To alleviate the above difficulty, Domain Randomization (introduced by NVIDIA) proposes to randomize the input so as to minimize the need for artistic design of the environment.

We will demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively, the power of using Synthetic Data with Domain Randomization as a technique to improve the performance of the neural network on object detection using the KITTI 2D Object detection dataset.
